        <p>
            Hello, my name is Clyde McNeil. I am currently enrolled into the Deep Dive Coding
            Bootcamp trying to hone and learn the concepts on what it takes to be a Full Stack
            Web Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I am hoping to gain in this course are the practical skills needed to help land
            a good job and enter into the tech industry.
        </p>
